Stick latest MalletEngine.jar here : located ./MalletEngine/build/jar
Copy ./MalletEngine/build/jar/libs here - contains JogAmp libraries

Resultant folder should then contain:

	'base' folder
	'README.txt' (This)
	'run'
	'MalletEngine.jar'
	'libs' folder

Will write up a script to automate this process.
