This Template Project is current set up to quickly build a desktop application.
For the Template Project to compile and run you will need to compile the Desktop 
version of the Mallet Engine.

Stick './MalletEngine/desktop/build/jar/libs' and './MalletEngine/desktop/build/jar/MalletEngine.jar' 
into './TemplateProject/build/jar/', you can stick MalletEngine.jar into the 'libs' directory.

The Template Project will fail to run without './MalletEngine/desktop/build/jar/base/shaders' copy 
this to './TemplateProject/build/jar/base/'

Resultant folder should then contain:

	'base/shaders/...'
	'README.txt' (This)
	'run'
	'libs/*.jar'
	'libs/*MalletEngine.jar'
